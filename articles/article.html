<p><em><span style="font-size:12pt;">Prompt: &nbsp;Why was the Gilded Age such a transformative and disruptive period in American social history? &nbsp; This period brought the beginnings of modern culture--how did this transition strain the lives of individuals and create social tensions? &nbsp;Ultimately was this a period to celebrate or criticize? &nbsp; Did we become who we are in the Gilded Age or was this the period where our original values were challenged and ultimately betrayed?</span></em></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:12pt;">The period from the mid-1870&rsquo;s until the turn of the century is known loosely as &ldquo;The Gilded Age.&rdquo; &nbsp;As the name suggests, this was a time when plutocrats (America&rsquo;s first millionaires) used corporations to consolidate their wealth and power. &nbsp;The middle class, managers, lawyers, bankers, and other professionals meanwhile worried about where they stood in this new social order. &nbsp;With millions of immigrants pouring into east coast ports, drawn by the numerous industrial jobs across the country, the growth of cities also meant the growth of slums, poverty and crime. &nbsp;Since many of these &ldquo;New Immigrants&rdquo; were from Southeastern Europe, they were more swarthy and most were neither Protestant (most were Catholic, Jewish, or Eastern Orthodox) nor &ldquo;white&rdquo;. &nbsp;They were seen as a dangerous menace, a potentially revolutionary mob. &nbsp;And with the emergence of a super-wealthy class who benefitted from this massive industrial growth, many Americans felt displaced and wondered what America would look like in the 20</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><sup><span style="font-size:0.6em;">th</span></sup></span><span style="font-size:12pt;">&nbsp;Century. &nbsp;Perhaps the most fearful and alienated were the small farmers in the West and South who saw the new urban order as a threat not only to their way of life but to their vision of what the nation should look like. &nbsp;So the &ldquo;Gilded Age&rdquo; was not a time when all benefitted&mdash;there was certainly great wealth amongst the industrial titans, but the middle class felt trapped, the immigrants struggled to find their way in foreign and often hostile urban settings frequently resorting to strikes and violence to redress their grievances, and farmers revolted too. &nbsp;The golden surface of this new society was not very thickly spread.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The emergence of railroads helped set not only the tempo of modern life but also allowed corporations to restructure and nationalize time itself. &nbsp;In the 1850&rsquo;s Americans set their watches to eighty local times&mdash;thirty eight in Wisconsin alone. &nbsp;Few Americans traveled far so there was no problem for town clocks to be set by charts in local almanacs. &nbsp;As railroads expanded and long distance travel became more common, time literally sped up. &nbsp;This was indicated by watchwords like &ldquo;on time&rdquo; and &ldquo;on the tick&rdquo; or &ldquo;on the clocker.&rdquo; &nbsp; As railroads requested Congressional legislation for more uniform &ldquo;standard&rdquo; times, many Americans felt they were now tied to the clock. &nbsp;A Cincinnati paper commented: &ldquo;Damn Vanderbilt&rsquo;s time! Today a nervous man cannot take out his watch and look at it &nbsp;when the time for an appointment or train is near.&rdquo; (thus was born the modern student clock-watching phenomenon in the final fifteen minutes of most classes). &nbsp;The result was a whole host of new nervous disorders&mdash;depression, anxiety, inability to concentrate, and a new disease called &ldquo;neurasthenia&rdquo;, a mild form of nervous breakdown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">But even as geographical barriers dropped, American democracy posed another formidable barrier to American industrialization. &nbsp;While the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers, and Carnegies made millions, each of the industries they dominated (railroads, oil, and steel) required low paid workers to maximize profit. &nbsp;As Werner Sombart, a German sociologist wrote: &ldquo;The new economic order needed part-humans: soulless, depersonalized, disembodied people who could become members or little wheels rather of a complex mechanism.&rdquo; &nbsp;As immigrants poured into urban ghettos and into unregulated and soulless factories, their frustrations grew. &nbsp;Farmers also felt this new urban environment was foreign and dangerous. &nbsp;Now danger lurked everywhere. &nbsp;Farmers and industrial workers realized the injustice and soon there were armed immigrant strikers and bands of barefoot farmers on the plains writing up socialist legislation calling for nationalization of railroads, shorter work days, and the outlawing of private armies. &nbsp;This Populist Movement peaked in 1892 and they viewed corporate interests, bankers, and the politicians that supported them as their enemies. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Behind the Populist movement was a rejection of America&rsquo;s emerging urban, industrial identity. &nbsp;The movement stirred up a quiet, conservative people. &nbsp;Many were devout church goers and viewed the new urban setting as an apocalyptic vision of a secular (non-religious), materialistic, and ethnically polluted future. &nbsp;The steep drop in prices of wheat and cotton frustrated them. &nbsp;And then drought, fencing, railroads, unfair bank loans drove them over the edge. &nbsp;The Populists called for government support and the type of subsidies which would be later implemented in the New Deal. &nbsp;Farmers Alliances grew and as they did so did an army of lecturers who swarmed the South and West teaching their fellow farmers about economics and history. &nbsp;There is a class war and you are losing it. &nbsp;In some ways this movement had the feel of the early Tea Party, instead the emphasis here was on reforming government, not eliminating it. &nbsp;But the instinct was the same&mdash;the bankers, industrialists, and their supporters in the East were driving the heartland of the nation into submission. &nbsp;At the heart of this debate was who would define American identity in the century to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">At the same time labor disturbances swept across the country in the mid 1880&rsquo;s. &nbsp;Industrialists hired private guards through an agency known as the Pinkertons and their number ballooned to over thirty thousand by the early 1890&rsquo;s. &nbsp;Private armies now outnumbered the U.S. army&mdash;a sign that the new divisions in American society bordered on small scale civil war. &nbsp;When &nbsp;in 1886 a bomb exploded as police broke up a worker&rsquo;s demonstration in Haymarket Square in Chicago, fears of immigrant revolution escalated. &nbsp;Workers, aliens, radicals, and dynamite all had coalesced in one explosive incident. &nbsp;German anarchists had called a meeting of protest and then when the police arrived and tried to end it, a bomb was launched out of the shapeless crowd, killing one and mortally wounding &nbsp;six more. &nbsp;Unable to find the culprit, the state sped eight prominent anarchists through the courts and convicted seven of them to die. &nbsp;This battle between workers and industrial interests occurred repeatedly from the 1870&rsquo;s to the 1890&rsquo;s, beginning with a massive Railroad Strike in 1877, and culminating with a battle between Pinkertons and steel workers at the Homestead Factory in Pittsburgh in 1892. &nbsp;Were these radical immigrant workers really capable of becoming Americans? &nbsp;And weren&rsquo;t the run down urban areas that they lived in the complete opposite of the agricultural republic envisioned by Jefferson?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In the midst of this urban chaos and rural revolt, the American middle class also worked to protect its interests. &nbsp;In the antebellum period (pre-civil war), middle class society defined American culture. &nbsp; The absence of class and social divisions shocked those like Tocqueville who were used to entrenched aristocracies. &nbsp;By the 1890&rsquo;s America&rsquo;s nouveaux riches (new rich) were building mansions, resort palaces, and flaunting their wealth at parties featuring gilded swans, swimming pools filled with Champagne, and men dressed in tuxedos wearing gold wreaths and imitating European royalty. &nbsp;The easiest way to access this privilege was to marry into it, so well off families sent their children to elite boarding schools, swank country clubs, and high profile colleges in order to reinforce their class status. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">With the middle class feeling vulnerable, or &ldquo;status anxiety&rdquo; as the historian Richard Hofstadter puts it, they sought new ways of defining their social position. &nbsp;Whereas earlier in the 19</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><sup><span style="font-size:0.6em;">th</span></sup></span><span style="font-size:12pt;">&nbsp;century all that was necessary to be a doctor or lawyer was to read a few books, hang a shingle and start a practice. &nbsp;Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s experience of law school for example was based primarily on spending time in a friend&rsquo;s practice. &nbsp;But in the late 19</span><span style="font-size:12pt;"><sup><span style="font-size:0.6em;">th</span></sup></span><span style="font-size:12pt;">&nbsp;Century local medical groups sought &nbsp;to redefine the profession. &nbsp;The newly established American Medical Association now insisted on graduate schools and have established doctors serve as gatekeepers to the profession. &nbsp;With new emphasis on research, immunization, and public health, the medical profession went from a haven for quacks to a new social position of exalted prestige. &nbsp;Lawyers did the same thing. &nbsp;Law schools developed new more standardized curriculum. &nbsp;Law was now to be seen as a science and with the introduction of bar exams, legal societies, and prolonged education. &nbsp;Even businessmen who wanted to join existing corporations now required professional training before they entered into management. &nbsp;The prestige of a college was now one&rsquo;s calling card and status and class was defined in large part by where one went to college and graduate school. &nbsp;In order to become a doctor, lawyer, or even a teacher, you needed time, money, and training. &nbsp;Universities now became the gatekeepers to middle class professions and the amount of schooling required to enter one of the standard professions increased dramatically in the last decade of the nineteenth century. &nbsp;Graduate schools now had the power to legitimize those entering the upper middle class. &nbsp;This class remained almost exclusively male. &nbsp;Apart from teaching, a glorified form of babysitting, and social work, which allowed women to extend their maternal role into the public sphere, the rough and tumble of business, law, and medicine was for men only.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">America&rsquo;s violent and traumatic experience of the arrival of modernity created many casualties. &nbsp;Immigrants fought to recreate the familiar communities they experienced in their homelands in ethnic neighborhoods. &nbsp;Displaced Americans from rural environments struggled to make sense of the business and anonymity of the city. &nbsp;For most of the nineteenth century, Americans had resided in small, communal settings. &nbsp;The relative equality and uniformity of American culture, the very thing Tocqueville marveled at in the 1830&rsquo;s now disappeared as class divisions grew. &nbsp;And in this new social order it was white protestants on top, assimilated Irish, Germans in the middle and dark skinned Italians, Russians, and Eastern Europeans at the bottom. &nbsp;Most African Americans remained trapped in the violent and economically stagnant South and those who did make it North found themselves socially and economically isolated, rising only within their own communities but not crossing the color line, even in the more economically dynamic North. &nbsp;Americans fought to preserve the society they had known, but even as they re-defined their collective communities, this occurred within the new context of social class. &nbsp; As the economy changed and the cities grew, America grew into its modern self. &nbsp;It would take most of the next century for the American people to overcome the boundaries of race, ethnicity, and class that were established by 1900. &nbsp;The Populists in America&rsquo;s heartland, believed that their world had been destroyed. &nbsp;But what exactly had taken its place? &nbsp;Was this now simply a nation defined by corporate power, the super-wealthy, and those who helped do their bidding? &nbsp;If the new system of social class was now defined by many different levels of wealth and influence and frequently corresponded to ethnic and racial differences, what now held the country together?</span></p>
